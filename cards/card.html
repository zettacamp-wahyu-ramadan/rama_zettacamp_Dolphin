      <h1 class="title"><em>Oreo</em></h1>

      <p>
        <strong><em>Oreo (/&#900ɔ&#8758;rioʊ/)</em></strong> stylized as OREO is a brand of sandwich cookie consisting
        of two cocoa biscuits or cookie pieces with a sweet fondant filling. It was introduced by Nabisco on March 6,
        1912, and through a series of corporate acquisitions, mergers and splits both Nabisco and the Oreo brand have
        been owned by Mondelez International since 2012. Oreo cookies are available in over one hundred countries.
        Many varieties of Oreo cookies have been produced, and limited-edition runs have become popular in the 21st
        century.

      <p>
        Oreos are an imitation of the Hydrox chocolate cream-centered cookie introduced in 1908, but they outstripped
        Hydrox in popularity so much that many think Hydrox is an imitation of Oreo. Oreo is the best-selling cookie
        brand in the United States and, as of 2014, the best-selling cookie globally.

          <span class="cardTitle">Oreo Mini</span>

          <span>First introduced in 1991, these are miniature bite-sized versions of the original Oreo cookie. After
            being discontinued in the late 1990s, they were re-released in 2000 along with the redesigned 2001 Dodge
            Caravan minivan as part of a promotional tie-in with Daimler AG. Their packaging in the 1990s consisted
            of a "miniaturized" version of the full-sized cardboard tray and box used in Oreo packaging at the time.
            Their revised packaging consists of an aluminum foil bag. Oreo Minis are available with
            various flavors of crème filling including original, chocolate, strawberry, and the new mint flavor which
            debuted in 2015. As well as the bagged version, they are also sold in Nabisco To-Go Cups, lidded plastic
            cups which fit into car cup-holders (in line with other Nabisco snacks that come in miniature form, such as
            Nutter Butters). A Golden Oreo Mini was also made available after the Golden Oreo was released in 2004.
            According to the Oreo website, the slogan of the Oreo Mini is "Grab 'em. Pop 'em. Love 'em."</span>

          <span class="cardTitle">Oreo Golden</span>

          <span>First released in 2004, this has "golden" vanilla-flavored wafers on the outside of the cookie, as an
            alternative to the original chocolate-flavored wafers. Available with various flavors of crème filling
            including original, chocolate, lemon and birthday cake. The chocolate crème variety, being the reverse of
            the original cookie, was known as the Uh-Oh Oreo until 2007.</span>

          <span class="cardTitle">Oreo Cakesters</span>

          <span>Introduced in 2007, Oreo Cakesters are Oreo's version of a whoopie pie, soft chocolate snack cakes with
            vanilla, chocolate or peanut butter creme in the middle. They were discontinued in 2012. In 2021, a TikTok
            creator named Stefan Jonson started a movement to have them brought back. The same year, Nabisco announced
            that Cakesters would be making a return in 2022, including Oreo and Nutter Butter varieties.</span>

          <span class="cardTitle">Double Stuf Oreo</span>

          <span> Introduced in 1974, this variety has about double the normal amount of crème filling as the
            original (although a math teacher calculated that Double Stuf Oreos only had 1.86 times the amount of cream
            of normal Oreos.) Available with various flavors of crème filling: original, chocolate, peanut butter,
            cool mint, and birthday cake. In the UK these are called Double Creme Oreos and are only available in
            original flavor. The Golden Double Stuf Oreo, featuring golden Oreo wafers with a double portion of original
            vanilla-flavored crème, was introduced in 2009.</span>
